# My First GitHub Project

Welcome to my first GitHub repository!  
I'm learning how to use Git, GitHub, and how to contribute to open source projects.

## What is this?

This is a simple test repository to show basic activity on my account.  
I created this to explore how commits, repositories, and file management work on GitHub.

## Skills I'm Learning

- Git & GitHub basics
- Markdown formatting
- Command line tools
- Open source collaboration

## What's next?

I plan to start building simple web projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Thanks for visiting this repo!
